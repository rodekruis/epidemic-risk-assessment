docs and scripts to download Google Earth Engine (GEE) data.

1. Subscribe to GEE: https://signup.earthengine.google.com

3. Read the API docs: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine
4. Install the Python API (and required auxiliary software): https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install
5. Execute the python script 'get_data.py'. If you don't know how to execute a python script, follow these instructions: https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs108/guides/runpython.html

that's it! you should see images appearing in the directory where 'get_data.py' is running.
to get all needed data, you need to change the script accordingly; see the comment lines in the code to understand what needs to be changed.
